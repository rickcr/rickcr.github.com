The original learn technology had a lot of older tutorials dealing with first generations of web frameworks such as Struts, WebWork, and Wicket. Some of these
technologies are still going strong but have a come a long way since 2005 :)

If you happen to be here from a search engine redirect - possibly in search for some old tutorials (maybe your stuck supporting some legacy applications?) 
I have provided the old
source code and wars (above link.) In the early stages of the site there were not a lot of written up lessons, but if you need me to check if 
there was some documentation accompaning the source code, let me know the one your interested in and I will see what I have.
