One thing typically needed in any sort of web application is way to paginate a large list of data. On top of pagination, you also need a way to sort the data (typically be clicking a column header.) For small amounts of data the solution is always pretty simple, but when dealing with a large amount of data, it's a bit trickier since you rrarely want to pull back all the data at once and store it in memory.</p>
<p/>
In regard to pagination large amounts of data in ZK, there are some solutions floating around out there. I found this solution proposed <a href="http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/Small_Talks/2012/March/Handling_a_Trillion_Data_Using_ZK">http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/Small_Talks/2012/March/Handling_a_Trillion_Data_Using_ZK</a> but I couldn't really figure it out and, unless I'm missing something, it requires ALL your data to be stored server side (someone correct me if I'm wrong there?)  This seems sort of expensive. Most people are using something like Hibernate or MyBaitis (my choice) and I don't think it's worth populating EVERY object up front.    
</p>
<p>
Another approach found here <a href="http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/Small_Talks/2009/May/Paging_Sorting_with_a_filter_object">http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/Small_Talks/2009/May/Paging_Sorting_with_a_filter_object</a> is interesting as well but it confused me, since I started most of my learning of ZK recently with an MVVM approach and not dealing with the older controller based approach. This other approach is more like what I'm doing below <a href="http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/Small_Talks/2009/July/Handling_huge_data_using_ZK">http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/Small_Talks/2009/July/Handling_huge_data_using_ZK</a>, but I'm doing it all in my ViewModel. I'm sure purists won't like it but it seems like an easier approach than most of the other ones I've seen.
</p>
<p>
[ NOTE: At the time of this writing, one of my complaints is that ZK now allows an MVVM approach, which I love, but when you view forum posts or google solutions they are often using an older approach and trying to mix the two isn't as simple as I would like (probably mostly due to my ignorance.) I do wish someone would write some best practice documents of how to blend the two.  What I've ended up deciding to do in most cases, is to just do the things I want within my ViewModel directly. I'm sure this isn't the "pure" approach, and it certainly means the ViewModel has to know a bit more than it should about the UI, but I find it working for me and it certainly means the ViewModel has to know a bit more than it should about the UI. (Possible a SelectComposer would be better, but that has its own issues when you need to notify it from a ViewModel - having to listen on queue vs just listening for a GlobalCommand? Clean up issues then arise using listeners on queues.)  ]
</p>
<p>
Anyway, here is what I came up with. For now I'm just showing the relevant code.  I think it'll make sense without a downloadable example.
</p>
<p>
The plan was for this to become a nice walk-through tutorial/lesson. Hopefully I'll get around to it. In the meantime, I think many will be able to get a lot out of this sample application. If there are things wrong with it, please let me know by e-mail. If you are new to JSF (as I am at the moment), please ask general JSF/MyFaces questions on the MyFaces mailing list. Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of time right now to answer JSF/MyFaces specific questions, plus you are better off getting answers from those much more knowledgable than myself.
