	This is the same as 
	Andy Ma's excellent <a href="{% post_url 2007-12-09-struts2_hibernate %}">Struts2 Hibernate example</a> 
	listed on this site.  The same database setup and build.  
	The differences lie in the XML for the web application and Struts configuration and Java components. 
	 PicoContainer pioneered Constructor Injection, and true to that EmployeeAction now uses 
	constructor args to receive its dependencies:
<PRE class=decorated><CODE>
	  public class EmployeeAction extends ActionSupport {
	      // fields ..
	      public EmployeeAction(DepartmentService deptService, EmployeeService empService) {
	          this.deptService = deptService;
	          this.empService = empService;
	      }
	  }
</CODE></PRE>
	Other components within the web app are similarly changed, and former singleton accessors have been removed.
