This project is located on github here <a href="https://github.com/rickcr/mybatis-spring-zk-multimodule">https://github.com/rickcr/mybatis-spring-zk-multimodule</a>.
 
I suggest using this application example over the older <a href="http://learntechnology.net/2013/06/15/zk-mybatis-spring.html">Zk-mybatis-spring project</a>, since this new one uses a modular approach which is more 
 realistic in how you would typically set up a project. It uses three small maven modules: domain (basic pojos), services (mybatis persistence layer), web (ZK.)
